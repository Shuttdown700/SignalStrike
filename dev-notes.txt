NEW / UPDATED FEATURES
- added a terrain map with contour lines and trails, in addition to the satellite map
- automatically reloads user-plotted markers after restart
- ability to delete any map object (except distances) individually
- asks if you want to measure between points, before plotting
- batch map downloads is now CLI-based, not part of the GUI

--- STABLE RELEASE UPDATES ---

- ability to add some graphics (NAIs, friendly battle positions,etc)
    - buttons on the bottom or additional option from right click
- ability to plot an EW team without plotting their LOB details and getting the distance from targets
    - when bypassing an EWT, allow the MGRS grid to remain if input
    - the distance from TGT to EWT should look from EWTs without LOB data

--- ENHANCING EXISTING FEATURES ---

[LOGGING FUNCTION]
- Scroll to chose which logged target data to re-plot / reload
- add Zulu DTG logs files
- add path-loss description in log
- when reloading a past log, don't ask about bypassing EWTs
[EW FUNCTION]
- improve bounds for cut polygon (some extreme cuts extend beyond LOB)
- give estimate warning prior to executing batch download
- pass paramters to batch download... not command
- verified emitter at 10km, pushing 20W, reads 7.23km est with no foliage
- improve propogation model with new model

[USER INTERFACE]
- add a DTG datapoint to bottom left TGT data block in GUI
- provide option to input coordinates instead of MGRS
- add MGRS coord to Target FIX polygon pop-up
- remove the batch download function from the UI, replace with planning tool functionality
- add MGRS gridlines (perhaps a button to do this?)
- Various colors to right frame buttons
[TESTING]
- add system for testing to verify functionality when next features are added
[CODE STRUCTURE]
- remove hard-coded api key references
- set a standard padx, pady in defaults dict
- move log function to utilities
- move batch download function into utilities file
- split utilities file into multiple files, by category (RF, map, log, files, etc.)
- decorator to determine the time functions/processes take

--- ADDING NEW FEATURES ---

[ANALYSIS]
- log analysis tools
[ELEVATION DATA]
- utilize elevation and GPS data to give terrian context to EW function
[PLOT OBJs W/ OPACITY]
- right-click option to plot objectives w/ radius
[FORK GENERIC ICON REMOVAL]
- dropdown menu to choose different types of graphics to remove from overlay
[GENERIC MARKER LOG]
- create a function to log all generic marker data
[BLUETOOTH / WIFI CONNECTIVITY FOR TRANSFERING DATA]
- create a listener and transmission method for communicating data across a network
