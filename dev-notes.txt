--- STABLE RELEASE UPDATES ---

- a pop-up when plotting current location to let the user know why its frozen
- option to reload from last log: EW teams, generic markers
- ability to remove a single marker at a time, without having to delete all the markers at a single time
    - tap on icon, option to delete
    - be able to remove the distance line between generic markers
- the icon text to constrast the map (terrain map must use black, satellite map must use white)
- ability to add some graphics (NAIs, friendly battle positions,etc)
- don't center on clicked lobs or icons, messes when dragging around the map
- ability to plot an EW team without plotting their LOB details and getting the distance from targets
