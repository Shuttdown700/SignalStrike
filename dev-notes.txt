--- STABLE RELEASE UPDATES ---

- a pop-up when plotting current location to let the user know why its frozen
    - determine if GPS receiver is detected

- option to reload from last log: EW teams, generic markers
    - upon start, check for last log, ask if wanting to reload
    - implemented in the __init__
- ability to remove a single marker at a time, without having to delete all the markers at a single time
    - tap on icon, option to delete
    - Ask if you want to measure the distance between markers
- way to turn brightness down more iso night ops 
    - buttons on bottom increasing/decreasing brightness
- ability to add some graphics (NAIs, friendly battle positions,etc)
    - buttons on the bottom or additional option from right click
- don't center on clicked lobs or icons, messes when dragging around the map
    - don't let areas be clickable, only the lines (if anything)
- ability to plot an EW team without plotting their LOB details and getting the distance from targets
    - when bypassing an EWT, allow the MGRS grid to remain if input
    - the distance from TGT to EWT should look from EWTs without LOB data
- as the user if they want to plot a distance instead of automatically doing it
    - ability to delete distance measurements dynamically

--- ENHANCING EXISTING FEATURES ---

[LOGGING FUNCTION]
- Scroll to chose which logged target data to re-plot / reload
- add Zulu DTG logs files
- add path-loss description in log
- when reloading a past log, don't ask about bypassing EWTs
[EW FUNCTION]
- improve bounds for cut polygon (some extreme cuts extend beyond LOB)
- give estimate warning prior to executing batch download
- pass paramters to batch download... not command
- verified emitter at 10km, pushing 20W, reads 7.23km est with no foliage
- improve propogation model with new model

[USER INTERFACE]
- add a DTG datapoint to bottom left TGT data block in GUI
- provide option to input coordinates instead of MGRS
- add MGRS coord to Target FIX polygon pop-up
- remove the batch download function from the UI, replace with planning tool functionality
- add MGRS gridlines (perhaps a button to do this?)
[TESTING]
- add system for testing to verify functionality when next features are added
[CODE STRUCTURE]
- remove hard-coded api key references
- set a standard padx, pady in defaults dict
- move log function to utilities
- move batch download function into utilities file
- split utilities file into multiple files, by category (RF, map, log, files, etc.)
- decorator to determine the time functions/processes take

--- ADDING NEW FEATURES ---

[ANALYSIS]
- log analysis tools
[ELEVATION DATA]
- utilize elevation and GPS data to give terrian context to EW function
[PLOT OBJs W/ OPACITY]
- right-click option to plot objectives w/ radius
[FORK GENERIC ICON REMOVAL]
- dropdown menu to choose different types of graphics to remove from overlay
[GENERIC MARKER LOG]
- create a function to log all generic marker data
[BLUETOOTH / WIFI CONNECTIVITY FOR TRANSFERING DATA]
