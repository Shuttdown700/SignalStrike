--- ENHANCING EXISTING FEATURES ---

[LOGGING FUNCTION]
- key events for gui logs:

    - errors
    - dted profiles & their errors
    - log when attempting a dted profile
    - add markers / measurements
    - remove markers / measurements
    - log how far tarket is from the various EWTs

- key events for targeting logs
    - user inputs
    - calculate results (DTG, Target Class, Grid, Error)



- automatically check and download visual cpp build tools: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/ (required to compile required libraries)

- Scroll to chose which logged target data to re-plot / reload
- add Zulu DTG logs files
- add path-loss description in log
- when reloading a past log, don't ask about bypassing EWTs
- add user, target markers to the log
- use the logging feature for standard actions

[EW FUNCTION]
- improve bounds / backstops for cut polygon (some extreme cuts extend beyond LOB)
- verified emitter at 10km, pushing 20W, reads 7.23km est with no foliage
- improve propogation model with new model

[USER INTERFACE]
- add a DTG datapoint to bottom left TGT data block in GUI
- provide option to input coordinates instead of MGRS
- add MGRS coord to Target FIX polygon pop-up
- add MGRS gridlines (perhaps a button to do this?)
- Various colors to right frame buttons
- add option to add battle positions
- fix issue with marker number changing, likely need a seperate indexing column in the marker log file

[TESTING]
- add system for testing to verify functionality when next features are added

[CODE STRUCTURE]
- remove hard-coded api key references
- set a standard padx, pady in defaults dict
- decorator to determine the time functions/processes take
 - remove hardcorded csv files in gui

--- ADDING NEW FEATURES ---

Add a right-click map option to add an EWT and then the data in input in the correct field
Add target presets (MILBAND, GCS, VTX)
browser-based map download feature
remove the import_libraries function

[ANALYSIS]
- post-mission log analysis tools
[ELEVATION DATA]
- utilize elevation and GPS data to give terrian context to EW function
[GENERIC MARKER LOG]
- create a function to log all generic marker data
[BLUETOOTH / WIFI CONNECTIVITY FOR TRANSFERING DATA]
- create a listener and transmission method for communicating data across a network
